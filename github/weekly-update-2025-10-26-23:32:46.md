# ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRES ATTENTION
- **Open PRs Needing Review**:
  - qp-zk-circuits #41: Dedup sum agg ‚Äì Critical for zk circuits.
  - chain #292: Local treasury pallet ‚Äì Governance feature.
  - chain #290: Remove quantum shortcut ‚Äì Audit fix, high priority for security.
  - quantus-apps #272: miner cleanup ‚Äì Impacts mining reliability.
  - quantus-cli #45: TX inclusion tracking ‚Äì CLI usability.

- **Ongoing Issues**:
  - rusty-falcon #1: Deterministic Falcon key gen ‚Äì Open discussion from manel1874.
  - No critical blockers, but monitor qp-poseidon audit responses for mainnet readiness.

üìà **Recommendations**: Prioritize PoW audit fixes (chain #290). Test leaderboards post-merge. Schedule release for qp-poseidon after PR #32. Total momentum strong ‚Äì focus on integration testing. üöß
