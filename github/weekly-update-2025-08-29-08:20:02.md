### üö® Items Requiring Attention

1.  **`Quantus-Network/chain` Sync Engine Fix (`#189`)**: `n13` has been very active on this, with many commits and internal comments, addressing a critical issue where nodes fail to sync on bad network connections. While significant progress is being made, this PR is still open and seems to involve complex logic with several reverts and refinements. It needs continued monitoring to ensure stability and successful integration.
    *   **Action:** Ensure thorough testing and review of the new sync engine logic.
2.  **`Quantus-Network/chain` External Miner Issue (`#192`)**: An issue was opened by `exunico` regarding "External miner fails to call runtime export," indicating a problem with the miner compiled for an older API/runtime. This is a critical bug affecting testnet miners.
    *   **Action:** Prioritize investigation and resolution of this critical issue.
3.  **`Quantus-Network/plonky2` Make nightly optional (`#4`)**: This PR by `dastansam` is still open and has a review comment from `illuzen` asking `ethan-crypto` for a glance.
    *   **Action:** `ethan-crypto` should provide their feedback to unblock this PR.
4.  **`Quantus-Network/poseidon-resonance` Injective Felt Embeddings (`#15`)**: `ethan-crypto` opened a new PR (`#15`) shortly after closing a similar one (`#14`) without merging. While this often indicates a re-submission with improvements, it's worth verifying the progression.
    *   **Action:** Ensure the new PR builds upon the previous work and is progressing as expected.
