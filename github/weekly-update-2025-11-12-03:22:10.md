### COMMITS
- **By User**:
  - **n13** (Lead Contributor): 25+ commits. Focused on reviews, PR merges, and fixes in chain (runtime upgrades, genesis), qp-zk-circuits (cert tweaks), quantus-apps (UI for Dirac, CLI updates), qp-rusty-crystals (constant-time signatures, API fixes), quantus-cli (pq-rusty-crystals integration), monitoring (metrics). Notable: Runtime upgrade coordination, dilithium/hdwallet releases.
  - **illuzen**: 15+ commits. Heavy in qp-rusty-crystals (constant-time sigs, infinite loop fix), chain (genesis blocks, upgrades), task-master (Prometheus). Released dilithium-v2.0.0, hdwallet-v1.0.0.
  - **dewabisma**: 10+ commits. Primarily in quantus-apps (UI notifications, mining stats), explorer (endpoint updates), monitoring (alerts, Docker fixes). Reviewed and merged chain PRs.
  - **czareko**: 8 commitments. PRs in monitoring (subsquid/task-master metrics, telemetry), chain (Heisenberg genesis, releases).
  - **dastansam**: Reviews in chain (rusty-crystals integration).
  - **ethan-crypto**: Commits in qp-zk-circuits (block header proof).
  - **github-actions[bot]**: Automated events for releases and issues (no code commits).

Commits cluster around runtime upgrades (e.g., misty-mountains), crypto enhancements (Falcon/Dilithium), and monitoring/tooling.

## REQUIRES ATTENTION
- **Open PRs (Priority Review)**: #290, #289, #288, #287, #286, #285, #284, #283, #25 (task-master), #46 (qp-rusty-crystals). These involve UI for new networks, miner stats, notifications, and metrics. Review for merges to stabilize features like Dirac support and error fixes.
- **Runtime Upgrades**: Chain issues #302 (v0.3.0-kingfisher), #306 (v0.4.0-misty-mountains) - coordinate deployment, ensure no blockers. Involves KAT tests, genesis updates.
- **Open Issues**: Runtime upgrade tracking (#302, #306) - review for coordination. Rusty-falcon #1 (deterministic key gen discussion; closed but monitor for crypto security).
- **Security/Perf Notes**: Focus on constant-time signatures in qp-rusty-crystals (illuzen commits) for HD wallet. Verify telemetry in monitoring for production stability.
- **General**: High release velocity; ensure testing for chain upgrades. Explore pending PRs in quantus-apps for user-facing bugs (e.g., mining target stat). No critical blockers, but prioritize crypto libs for audits (e.g., Falcon randomness).
