### USER
- **dastansam** (8 events): Heavy on zk-circuits and poseidon; reviews and pushes.
- **ethan-crypto** (2 events): Reviewed PR #19 in qp-plonky2.
- **dewabisma** (10+ events): Led raid quest implementation in task-master; DB migrations and UI updates.
- **illuzen** (multiple events): Merged PRs in chain, quantus-miner; GPU engine work.
- **n13** (multiple forks/creates): Contributed to polkadart, rusx, keystone firmware; no-std and signing fixes.
- **quantus-network-ci** (multiple): Automated merges and releases across zk-circuits, poseidon, miner.
- **czareko** (multiple): Merged in quantus-miner and chain; release coordination.
- **grenade** (1 event): PR in quantus-miner for BMI2 CPU fix (ancient, closed).

Contributions distributed; dastansam and dewabisma most active in core tech.

## REQUIRES ATTENTION
- **[Open PR #19 in qp-plonky2](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/qp-plonky2/pull/19)**: Monolithic Poseidon2 gate implementation. Has reviews from ethan-crypto (suggestions on constants and GPU). Stuck; assign final reviewer or close if superseded.
- **[Open PR #46 in task-master](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/task-master/pull/46)**: Configurable whitelist. Recent; needs testing and merge.
- **[Fork of polkadart by n13](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/polkadart)**: Potential integration fork; review for upstreaming get_fee API changes.
- **Keystone Firmware Branches**: quantus/9/hybrid and quantus/8/keystone_hardware_build_2 are active but unmerged; test hardware compatibility before next release.
- **Unmerged Forks**: qp-rusty-crystals (no-std branch); ensure alignment with main branch.
- **Potential Conflicts**: Multiple engine updates in quantus-miner; verify no regressions in hybrid GPU/CPU mode post-v2.0.2.
- **Security Note**: No vulnerabilities reported, but review recent forks (e.g., polkadart, rusx) for upstream security alignments.

Overall, strong momentum on zk and mining features. Focus next sprint on completing open PRs and firmware sync. Contact active contributors (dastansam, dewabisma) for blockers.
