## REQUIRES ATTENTION
- **Open PRs**:
  - qp-zk-circuits #65: Open with Copilot review comments on potential bugs (e.g., range check mismatch, overflow in aggregation, unclear docs). High priority - critical for privacy features; address before merging.
    - Link: https://github.com/Quantus-Network/qp-zk-circuits/pull/65
  - qp-zk-circuits #64: Open, no reviews yet. Depends on asset ID aggregation; test integration.
    - Link: https://github.com/Quantus-zk-circuits/pull/64
  - chain #347: Open for wormhole fix; verify against main branch.
    - Link: https://github.com/Quantus-Network/chain/pull/347
  - qp-rusty-crystals #50: Open, branch-only activity; needs full review for threshold feature.
    - Link: https://github.com/Quantus-Network/qp-rusty-crystals/pull/50

- **Closed Issues (Resolved)**:
  - quantus-apps #345 (Sending Failed doesn't remove transaction): Closed.
  - quantus-apps #343 (Funky Auth Timer): Closed.

- **Recommendations**:
  - Review Copilot flags in #65 (e.g., u32 overflow in circuits, git dependency instability, precision loss in quantization).
  - Monitor integration PRs (e.g., wormhole in chain #347).
  - High activity in UI (quantus-apps) and crypto (qp-zk-circuits); ensure tests pass for releases.
  - No major open issues, but watch for regressions in merged PRs like hardware wallet support (#355).
