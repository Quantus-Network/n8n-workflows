# REQUIRES ATTENTION
- **Open PR in chain**: [#365](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/chain/pull/365) (High-Security Integration for Multisig Pallet) - Open since 2026-01-29; pending review; critical for runtime integration (dependency inversion needed).
- **Closed without merge**: [#366](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/chain/pull/366) in chain (explicit cleanup extrinsic) - Closed by n13; may need re-opening if required.
- **Review Comments Pending**: 
  - In PR 365: Benchmarking issue (underweighting due to call data size); architecture recommendation (invert HighSecurityInspector dependency).
  - In PRs (e.g., 375 in quantus-apps): Minor UI fixes needed (e.g., magic styles, bio input validation).
- **No Unassigned Issues**: All related issues/PRs assigned or closed; monitor for new ones on multisig and mining stability.
- **Performance Notes**: QUIC miner integration needs testing for high load; multisig cleanup may risk DoS if not bounded (recommend limit to 5 proposals per call).
