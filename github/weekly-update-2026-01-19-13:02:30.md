## Requires Attention ⚠️
- **Open PRs Needing Review:** 5 open PRs, some stalled (e.g., #66 in qp-zk-circuits pending since Jan 15; #352 in chain for multisig also open). Prioritize chain PRs (#353, #351) for Wormhole fixes and high-security integrations.  
  - [qp-zk-circuits #66](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/qp-zk-circuits/pull/66) – Aggregation example (opened Jan 15, assigned dastansam).  
  - [quantus-apps #366](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/quantus-apps/pull/366) – High-security UI (opened Jan 16, recent activity).  
  - [chain #354](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/chain/pull/354) – Quantized funding (opened Jan 18, low activity).  
  - [chain #353](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/chain/pull/353) – Validate unsigned Wormhole (opened Jan 16, assigned).  
  - [chain #352](https://github.com/Quantus-Network/chain/pull/352) – Custom multisig (opened Jan 16).  

- **Potential Issues:** No explicit issues, but watch for integration risks in Wormhole-related PRs (e.g., unsigned validation). Wiki edits on multisig spec need verification for accuracy. All repos are active, but monitor qp-poseidon #56 for breaking changes in quantization (Copilot flagged).  

**Recommendations:** Merge high-priority chain PRs to stabilize Wormhole. Review stalled PRs by EOW. Schedule a sync on high-security app features. Total open: 5 PRs across 3 repos. 📋
