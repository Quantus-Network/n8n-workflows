### üìù Notes and Observations

*   **High Activity:** `n13` has been exceptionally active this past week, primarily on the `Quantus-Network/chain` repository, focusing on sync engine fixes and high-security account implementation. This includes a significant number of commits and detailed PR comments.
*   **PR Churn:** `ethan-crypto` closed PR #14 on `poseidon-resonance` and immediately opened PR #15 for "injective felt embeddings" in the same repository. This indicates iterative development, possibly addressing review feedback by creating a new PR rather than updating the old one.
*   **New Repository:** `illuzen` created a new repository `n8n-workflows` for automations, suggesting an expansion of internal tooling or infrastructure.
*   **Review Feedback:** `illuzen` provided a review and approval on `Quantus-Network/chain#188` and requested a glance from `ethan-crypto` on `Quantus-Network/plonky2#4`. This indicates active collaboration on PRs.
*   **Community Engagement:** `exunico` opened an issue on `Quantus-Network/chain` regarding a miner runtime export failure, indicating community interaction and potential for external contributions or crucial bug reports.
*   **Draft PRs:** There are a couple of draft PRs (`Quantus-Network/chain#193` and `Quantus-Network/chain#190` - though #190 was closed). It's good to keep an eye on these to ensure they progress or are formally closed when no longer needed. The description for #190 explicitly states "won't be used," suggesting it was for code cleanup/exploration.
